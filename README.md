# Chain Codes
> Implementation of the chain codes algorithm in java 8.

A small project for detecting the boundaries of simples shapes in black and white grayscales images. Implemented in Java 8.

## Installing / Getting started

All that is needed is the standart java 8 oracle package. The program can be run by using:

```shell
java ChainCodes -jar
```

When this happens, the program will run the border dectection on the image specified in the source code. Sample images are included and run by default.

## Developing

To partake in the project, just clone it and modify the source code, the send a pull request.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/BrunoGomesCoelho/ChainCodes.git
cd ChainCodes
```
## Features

* Finds the border of any shape in black and white images.
* Calculates the maximum height and width of the shape
* Also calculates the perimeter of the shape.

## Contributing
